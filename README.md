## What did I do?
I made my best in this project with a little differences, for example: Instead I develop the fire base assigment, I made it using Commerce.js  and there is where I create the order with the folder /lib and the keys are into the .env file. I prefered to make a general section with all products, and not just a single page with the details. I hope you guys can watch my project more or less to pass to the next level at least. 

*Aditional, I fetch the API location to address the people in the checkout section. To finish, I setup the mobile view as well, that's it!
